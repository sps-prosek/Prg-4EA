                <h2>Portal 2</h2>
                <p>The first Portal might be one of the best physics demos ever made. It's a tight, funny puzzle
                    experience that also introduced audiences to one of video games' most iconic villains, GLaDOS.
                    But then Valve followed it up with Portal 2, showing that there was so much more to explore in
                    Aperture Science's deranged depths, from experiments with moon rocks to the use of AI for more
                    diabolical ends. The game is hilarious, with the addition of Wheatley and Cave Johnson among
                    some of its highlights, and the puzzles are more involved and challenging. What catapults it so
                    high on our list, though, is its heart. It's a game filled to the brim with joy, whether you're
                    learning to love a potato or messing with friends in its multiplayer mode. Portal 2 not only
                    shows what you can do with a sequel but also how to make a game you can love.</p>

                <h2>Half-Life 2</h2>
                <p>The original Half-Life is often credited as being among the first narrative-driven first-person
                    shooters, but Half-Life 2 only built on the world Valve established with its 1998 release.
                    Engaging gunplay and a groundbreaking physics system took center stage when Half-Life 2 was
                    released, but the open-ended narrative and creative world has spawned fan speculation and
                    engagement even two decades after the game came out. It also laid the foundation for
                    gameplay-centered storytelling, influencing a new generation of games in a genre that previously
                    opted for straight action or strict cutscene limits of narrative development.</p>
